# TravelShare

This repository contains the source code for **TravelShare**, a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in my mobile programming course during my Computer Science master's degree.
The goal of this project is to design and implement a complete Android app from scratch, applying the concepts and techniques taught throughout the course.

## Overview

**TravelShare** is an application centered on the discovery and sharing of travel photos. It allows users to explore real travel experiences posted by other people and contribute their own content once authenticated.

The app provides two usage modes:

* **Anonymous mode:** browse publicly shared photos, view information such as the location, date, comments, and tips on how to reach the place; like/unlike photos; and report problematic content.
* **Connected mode:** create an account, publish photos, share them publicly or within groups, add text, voice notes, or AI-assisted annotations, comment on posts, and receive notifications when users, groups, or locations of interest have new activity.

Users can explore photos through random discovery or by filtering by type of place, time period, author, proximity to a location, or visual similarity. A map view and a detailed photo page support deeper exploration. From any photo, the user can open a navigation route to the location in a mapping app.

This project aims to demonstrate practical knowledge of Android development, including UI design, data handling, user authentication, media management, permissions, notifications, and integration with external intents.
